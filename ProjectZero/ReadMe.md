Why this Project?

Data analysis involves reasoning about data, documenting your thought process and communicating results and actions. Your best analysis is only as good as your ability to communicate it. This project provides you an opportunity to work with a popular tool and gain confidence in interpreting data. You will also get a chance to apply what you've learned in Lesson 1 of Statistics using Python. You'll be going deeper in this direction during Introduction to Data Science and Project 2.

Additionally, this project will familiarize you with project submission, project review, and project feedback.
What will I learn?

You will learn how to open an IPython notebook, run commands in an IPython notebook, and export your work as an HTML document to share. You'll also analyze the design of an experiment and interpret the results.
Why is this important to my career?

    As a Data Analyst, you will analyze data using programming languages (like Python, R and SQL) and other related packages.
    Your day to day work as an analyst involves using a documentation tool to efficiently create, edit, and share data analyses.
