This project will introduce you to the data analysis process that you will be using throughout the rest of the Nanodegree program. In this project, you will go through the entire process so that you know how all the pieces fit together. Later Nanodegree projects will focus on individual pieces of the data analysis process. In this project, you will also gain experience using the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier!
What will I learn?

After completing the project, you will:

    Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
    Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
    Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
    Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
    Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and Pandas to speed up your data analysis code
    Be familiar with Pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
    Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings

Why is this Important to my Career?

This project will show off a variety of data analysis skills, as well as showing potential employers that you know how to go through the entire data analysis process.
